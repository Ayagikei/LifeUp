Instead of build-in attributes such as strength, knowledge, etc.
You can also create your own skills such as fishing, writing.
Try adding tasks to your skills and leveling them up!
Track your level with achievements to unlock exclusive rewards when you reach the goal.
The growth of attributes and skills in the application is also equivalent to digitally reflecting your growth, prompting you to stay more motivated and powerful.

üéÅ **Shop**

Abstract your task reward into the app as a shop item, whether it is a realistic reward, a reward for rest and entertainment time, or a stat reward in the app, such as taking a 30 mins break, watching a movie, or getting a random coin reward.

üèÜ **Achievements**

In addition to dozens of built-in achievements waiting for you to unlock, you can create your own to track your progress: such as auto tracking the number of task completions, levels, and item usage times.
Or create your realistic milestones like arrived in a city!


‚è∞ **Pomodoro**

Use the Pomodoro to stay connected and stay motivated.
As a Pomodoro timer is completed, you can receive a virtual üçÖ reward.

## Repository

### Closed source

Sorry about that *LifeUp* is not open sourced anymore since 17 May 2019 when someone package it with inserting some harmful ads and put the tampered version on some app market.

Some other reasons:
- There is still a lot of old code that has not been refactored
- Most of the code comments are not currently written in English and are not universal enough
- Some code involving secure is not convenient to open source

We're planning to *partially* open source in the future.

<br/>

**Please feel free to open issues about your questions, the problem you encountered and feature requests.**

### Translations

We expect to publish the application in multiple languages, but due to limited resources, it is difficult to request a professional translation.

Therefore, the translation of the application has always been contributed by community users.
We recently hosted the translation of the application on the Crowdin platform.

If you are interested in translating or proofreading, you can check here:

[Ayagikei/LifeUp-Translation: The raw text resource of LifeUp. Welcome to contribute more language! (github.com)](https://github.com/Ayagikei/LifeUp-Translation)

<br/>

### Documents

With the addition of application functions and the increased usage costs brought about by the high degree of freedom, we plan to maintain a usage document.

The content is still rough, and contributions are welcome.
