## Introduction

**LifeUp**,  whose name means UPGRADE YOUR LIFE, is a gamification To-Do List (Tasks List) application with many interesting gamified features.

It's is inspired by [Level Up Life](https://lvluplife.com/) and [a question on Zhihu.](https://www.zhihu.com/question/25365158) at the beginning of development, but then **a unique and high degree of freedom reward (shop items), achievement, and synthesis system was formed.**

At the beginning of development, **a set of RPG attribute experience value feature is provided out of the box, and it is perfectly integrated with achievements, rewards, and Pomodoro features.**

**It is worth mentioning that each feature supports both collaborative use and independent use.**

> This is an independent application and is currently only maintained by two developers and one tester in their spare time.

## Repository

### Closed source

Sorry about that *LifeUp* is not open source anymore since 17 May 2019 when someone package it with inserting some harmful ads and put the tampered version on some app market.

Some other reasons:
- There is still a lot of old code that has not been refactored
- Most of the code comments are not currently written in English and are not universal enough
- Some code involving secure is not convenient to open source

We're planning to *partially* open source in the future.

### Issues

**Please feel free to open issues about your questions, the problem you encountered and feature requests.**

### Translations

We expect to publish the application in multiple languages, but due to limited resources, it is difficult to request a professional translation.

Therefore, the translation of the application has always been contributed by community users.
We recently hosted the translation of the application on the Crowdin platform.

If you are interested in translating or proofreading, you can check here:

[Ayagikei/LifeUp-Translation: The raw text resource of LifeUp. Welcome to contribute more language! (github.com)](https://github.com/Ayagikei/LifeUp-Translation)

<br/>

### Documents

With the addition of application functions and the increased usage costs brought about by the high degree of freedom, we plan to maintain a usage document.

The content is still relatively small, and contributions are welcome.
